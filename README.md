## HomeToGo (Clone)
In this project we have tried to make a look alike clone of HomeToGo Website. With our efforts and the technology stack, that we have learned till now in Unit-4 in Masai School, we were able to clone the front end, integrated it with backend and added similar looks and features..

## Technologies we used

  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>Nodejs</li>

All the data got stored in and called from Mongo Atlas cloud database.
